# Tests

TODOs:

- [ ] Described what is tested by the included automated tests (a bit like what is done [here](https://github.com/gorodnitskiy/yet-another-lightning-hydra-template?tab=readme-ov-file#tests))
- [ ] Add some examples of how to run tests
- [ ] describe why the test files are next to the source files, and why TDD is good, and why ML researchers should care more about tests.
- [ ] Explain how the fixtures in `conftest.py` work (indirect parametrization of the command-line overrides, etc).
- [ ] Describe the Github Actions workflows that come with the template, and how to setup a self-hosted runner for template forks.
- [ ] Add links to relevant documentation ()
